I began by importing both the os and csv modules, but then I ran into some issues finding the path to the csv file 'election_data.csv'. I found a helpful hint on this page: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-path-to-the-given-file-using-python/ (Method 4) that was able to return the path to the file. Then, I was able to open the csv file, specify the delimiter, skip the header, and begin looping through the rows of text. I began the loop by creating a dictionary called votesPerCandidate with the names of the candidates as keys and the number of votes they received as values, and declared each line in the csv file as the variable "ballot". From here I was able to get the number of votes each candidate received by incrementing by one if the loop recognized the name in index [2] as "seen", otherwise defaulting the value to 0 if index [2] had not been seen before, and adding the totals each candidate recieved to get the total number of votes. Here, I found that the '.update()' method can immediately a new key-value pair, so I used this to update the dictionary whenever it found a new name in index [2] (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_update.asp). For percentages, I began a new dictionary with names as keys and percentages as values (multipled by 100), and initialized an equality to find a winner (looping through the dictionary's values to find the biggest percentage). Finally, print results.
